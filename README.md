## Brief Backround

After getting a degree from SDSU, I spent a few years in customer service while doing creative freelancing work on the side.
Discovered [Processing][processing], which spurred me to take programming classes; got a chance to explore different fascinating domains like DSP, computer graphics and machine learning.
Found myself very drawn to web application development, because this field is full of high-impact potential to solve many practical problems.
Recent subjects: typescript + react + redux
Upcoming subjects: express.js + mongodb + graphql
