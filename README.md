## About me

After spending some years exploring my interests in the arts, I discovered a deep interest in computer science and relevant domains.
I'm still in an exploratory stage, some areas I've touched on: Graphics processing, Machine Learning, DSP; I'm currently enrolled at my local communtiy college district with the intention of deepening my knowledge in computers and mathematics.
Lately, web technologies have been growing on me.
I have an unusual interest in text editors.
