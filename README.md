## About me
After spending some years exploring my interests in the arts, I discovered a passion for computer science and it's trappings.
I'm still in an exploratory stage, learning about various domains that intrigue me: Graphics processing, Machine Learning, and DSP; while taking courses in computer science at local colleges.
Lately, web technologies have been really growing on me.
I'm addicted to emacs, no matter how hard I try, I just can't quit it.
