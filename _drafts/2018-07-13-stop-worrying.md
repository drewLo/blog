I susbscribed to adobe CC tonight. Despite a 'hipster' tendency to avoid things which are mainstream, I've come around to realizing that 'the path less traveled' is a means to a life of unnecessary struggle. The first turning point was investing my time towards learning programming funcdamentals over creative pursuits. I considered my possible futures; a life of trying to extract money from my passion, or portions of my life sold away so that I may protect my passion and drive free from the influence of money.

I chose the latter. It's been a process making the mental adustments. The thoughts I recant in my head that previously told me to 'get back to work on music', became punishing when I'd hear new works or previous colleagues and collaborators making progress. On a positive note, shifting my perspectice has afforded a more reacreational tone when I do work on music. 

This newfound 'fun' in audio-visual synthesis has been a slow process but I think it'll prove to be the most optimally balanced route in the long run.

I've tried to apply this lens of insight to other aspects of my life. For instance, I was previously pushing myself to study advanced topics of computer science: machine learning/deep learning/ai, computer vision, graphics processing, digital signal processing, and so on. Upon furhter reflection, I think these topics were in a way, a self deception. In an effort to avoid a 'crummy' web dev job, I deprived myself of learning a skillset of an in-demand field which aligns with my personal circumstances. There it was, staring at me in the face, breadcrumb, by breadcrumb. This blog became a step in the right direction in that regard.
