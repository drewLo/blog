Tomorrow San Diego Mesa Community College is having their first [hackathon][mesa-csc]. Coincidentally, it's also my first hackathon.

# Pre-thoughts

I'm not sure what to expect, I'm bringing my equipment and a small idea and we'll see how it goes.
The rest of this post will take place after the event.

# Post-thoughts

It certaintly proved to be a learning experience.
The event had a lot of effort placed into it. There was lots of food laid out and t-shirts for the attendees.
The theme was Environmental Sustainability. Guest mentors from IEEE and Space and Naval Warfare Systems were there.
We were the first table they checked in with. My group didn't have an idea, so I mentioned my backup, a simple application to help with some personal gardening tasks.
A guest speaker (a professor from the geology department) and the mentors were somewhat vocal that they did not think the idea was very good, encouraging our team to instead work on something "non-trivial", that "other people would use", because "this is a competition".
To be honest, it had me taken aback. I thought my idea had at least been reasonable, and could be (mostly) accomplished in the 8-10 hour time frame of the event.
Admittedly, I had great difficulty focusing on the event after that, and shortly thereafter I bowed out. I thanked the club president and a few volunteers for their contribution to the event on my way out. 

In retrospect, I regret not shrugging it off, I should have had thicker skin. I was nervous about my first hackathon and felt slightly exposed in a team of all strangers, insecure about my own abilities and capacity to contribute. The remarks about my idea from the mentors probably meant well, but the way they phrased their criticism was discouraging. It was in stark contrast to what I read online about these types of events leading up to it.
The club's vice president reached out after I mentioned it in slack; he explained the mentors had not been briefed on what was expected from the participants.

Despite this negative experience, I look forward to my next opportunity to participate in another one down the road.
