Tomorrow San Diego Mesa Community College is having their first [hackathon][mesa-csc]. Coincidentally, it's also my first hackathon.

## Pre-thoughts
I'm not sure what to expect, I'm bringing my equipment and a small idea and we'll see how it goes.
The rest of this post will take place after the event.

## Post-thoughts
It certaintly proved to be a learning experience. 
The event had a lot of effort placed into it. There was lots of food laid out and t-shirts for the attendees.
The theme was Environmental Sustainability. Guest mentors from Space and Naval Warfare Systems were there.
We were the first table they checked in with. My group didn't have an idea, so I brought mentioned my backup, a simple app to help automate some gardening tasks.
A guest speaker (a professor from the geology department) and the mentors did not think the idea was very good, encouraging our team to instead work on something "non-trivial", that "other people would use", because "this is a competition". 
To be honest, I was taken aback. I thought my idea had at least been reasonable, let alone could be accomplished in the 8-10hour time frame. 
However the damage was done, shortly after I bowed out. Not without first thanking the club president and a volunteers for their contribution to the event. 

In retrospect, I should have had thicker skin. I was nervous about my first hackathon and felt slightly exposed, insecure about my own abilities and capacity to contribute to my team.
The club's vice president reached out after I mentioned it in slack, he explained the mentors had not been adequately briefed on what was expected from the participants.

Despite this experience, I look forward to my next opportunity to try again, maybe at a different location.
