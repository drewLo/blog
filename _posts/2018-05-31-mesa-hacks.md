Tomorrow San Diego Mesa Community College is having their first [hackathon][mesa-csc]. Coincidentally, it's also my first hackathon.

## Pre-thoughts
I'm not sure what to expect, I'm bringing my equipment and a small idea and we'll see how it goes.
The rest of this post will take place after the event.

## Post-thoughts
It certainly proved to be a learning experience. 
The event clearly had a lot of effort placed into it. There was lots of 'starter' food laid out and t-shirts for the attendees.
The theme was 'Enironmental Sustainability'. Guest mentors courtesy of Space and Naval Warfare Systems.
We were the first table they checked in with. My group didn't have an idea, so I brought up mine, a simple appto help automate some gardening tasks.
A guest speaker (a professor from the geology department) and the mentors did not seem to think the idea was very good, encouraging our team to instead work on something "non-trivial", that "other people would use". 
To be honest, I was taken aback. I was the only one of the 4-person group with an idea, let alone one that could be accomplished in the 8-10 hour time frame. 
However the damage was done, shortly after I bowed out. Not without first thanking the club president and a several volunteers for their contribution to putting on the event.

In retrospect, I should have had thicker skin. I was nervous about my first hackathon and felt vulnerable, even insecure about my own abilities and capacity to contribute to my team.
The club's vice president reached out after I mentioned what happened in slack, he explained that the mentors had not been adequately briefed on what was expected from the participants. 

Despite my intial experience, I look forward to my next opportunity to participate in one of these events.
