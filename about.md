This Blog: This site is intended to document (in a public way) my discoveries, interests and observations with regard to my pursuits in computer science coming from a backround in the humanities & the arts. 

Me: Entangled by a profound fascination with the connection between Aesthetics & Computation. Currently working on an education in computer science to make contributions to projects I use consistently. Interests in audio-visual technologies, digital signal processing, Linux, machine learning/deep learning, computer vision, stochastics, graphics, performance computing, data-driven research, and distributed systems.
My bachelor's degree was not in a quantitative field, I am nevertheless working towards a graduate program and/or taking a professional position.
