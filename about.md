This site: tracking fixes, hosting guides, project reflections.

Me: Aspiring application dev with emphasis on web technologies. 
Prior experience in the music industry and as a freelance graphic designer. 
Content creation exposed me to several interesting domains: signal processing (Max, openFrameworks), graphics (TouchDesigner, Processing), and computer vision (openCV, Kinect). 
First real language was C (via cs50x), then C++ while learning data structures at a local college. 
Since completing that, javascript(typescript) has been my primary tool, 
A visually-oriented thinker with a generalist approach to problem solving seems to be somewhat unique in the software world; I used to see it as my weakness but it's actually an advantage. It keeps the forest in mind when navigating the trees.
