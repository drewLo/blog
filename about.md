This site: keeping track of fixes, hosting guides, commentary.

Me: I have a lot of interests; too many in fact. My loves in life are my partner, my art(mainly music), and software. I live in a city that has amazing weather year-round. I'm attending college to become a better developer. Extra fond of classical and electronic music. Dislikes: advertisements, boring introduction chapters, and writing self descriptions.
