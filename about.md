This Blog: Intended to document (in a public way) my discoveries, interests and observations with regard to my pursuits in computer science, coming from a backround in the humanities & the arts. 

Me: Entangled by a fascination with the bridge between computation and aesthetics. Currently taking classes about computer science to make contributions to projects I use consistently. Interests: audio-visual technologies, digital signal processing, Linux, machine learning/deep learning, computer vision, stochastics, graphics, performance computing, data-driven research, and distributed systems, and recently: web development.
