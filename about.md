This site: tracking fixes, hosting guides, project reflections.

Me: Aspiring application dev, with emphasis on web technologies. Prior experience in the music industry, and as a freelance graphic designer. Content creation exposed me several interesting domains, like signal processing (Max, openFrameworks), and graphics (TouchDesigner, Processing). First proper language was C (via cs50x), then enrolled at a nearby college for classes in C++ and data structures. Since completing those courses, javascript(typescript) has been my primary language, and it seems it will be that way for the foreseeable future. 
Being a visually oriented thinker with a generalist approach to problem solving seems to be somewhat unique in the software world. Suppose in that sense, I am very fortunate.
