This Blog: This site is intended to document (in a public way) my discoveries, interests and observations with regard to my pursuits in computer science coming from a backround in the humanities. 

Me: Entangled by a profound fascination with the connection between Aesthetics & Computation. Currently manifesting an education in computer science to be able to make significant contributions to the projects I get involved with. Interested in audio-visual technology, digital signal processing, GNU+Linux, machine learning/deep learning, computer vision, stochastic processes, graphics, performant computation, data-driven research, distributed systems.
My bachelor's degree was not in a quantitative field but nevertheless I am working towards enrolling in a graduate program or moving to a professional role.
