This Blog: Publicly documenting discoveries and observations with regard to my interests in computer science and programming.

Me: Deeply fascinated by the relationship between computation and aesthetics. Attending local community colleges to boostrap a career in software development. I'm interested in a lot of things: audio && visual tech, like signal processing and graphics APIs; linux; machine learning; computer vision; I have also dabbled in stochastics, performance computing, data-driven research, embedded and distributed systems. Lately I've been teaching myself how to build web applications in-between schoolwork. I've played music in some form since childhood and I attribute all of my other pursuits to it.
