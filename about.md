This site: keeping track of fixes, hosting guides, commentary.

Me: Have a lot of interests; too many in fact. Loves in life are my partner, my art (mainly music), and software. Live in a city that has amazing weather year-round. Attending college to become a better developer. Extra fond of classical and electronic music. Dislikes: advertisements, boring introduction chapters, and writing self descriptions.
